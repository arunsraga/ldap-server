ldap-server
===========

nodejs ldap server on top of mongodb

The purpose of this project is to provide a truly lightweight directory server using mongodb
as the backend server and nodes awesome event handling.

This project runs inside of docker to make it super easy to install, run, upgrade, maintain, etc. 
It's intended to be a complete drop in replacement for OpenLDAP so I will be working to add
as many features and exops as I can.
